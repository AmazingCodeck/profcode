<p>Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out<br>
    Get some air now, let your edge out<br>
    Too soon, I spoke, you be heavy in my mind<br>
    Can you get the heck out?<br>
    I need rest now, got me bummed out<br>
    You so, you so, you, baby, baby, babe<br>
    I've been on my empty mind shit<br>
    I try to keep from losin' the rest of me<br>
    I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, baby<br>
    You don't care<br>
    Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent<br>
    Tryna make sense of loose change<br>
    Got me a war in my mind<br>
    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me<br>
    Choose to watch<br>
    While the world break up and fall on me<br>
    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile<br>
    Still wanna try, still believe in (good days)<br>
    Good days, always (good days)<br>
    Always inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)<br>
    Good day living in my mind<br>
    Tell me I'm not my fears, my limitations<br>
    I disappear, if you let me<br>
    Feeling like (on your own)<br>
    Feeling like Jericho<br>
    Feeling like Job when he lost his shit<br>
    Gotta hold my own, my cross to bear alone, I<br>
    Ooh, paid a deal, way to kill the mood<br>
    Know you like that shit, yeah, groovy baby, baby<br>
    Heavy on my empty mind shit<br>
    I gotta keep from losin' the rest of me (losin' the rest of me)<br>
    Still worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe<br>
    You don't care<br>
    Said, not tryna be a nuisance, it's just urgent (it's urgent)<br>
    Tryna make sense of loose change<br>
    Got me a war in my mind (my mind)<br>
    Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holding me<br>
    Choose to watch<br>
    While the world break up and fall on me<br>
    All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile<br>
    Still wanna try, still believe in (good days, good days on my mind)<br>
    Good days (good days on my mind)<br>
    Always sunny inside (always in my mind, always in my mind, mind)<br>
    Good day living in my mind<br>
    Gotta get right, tryna free my mind before the end of the world<br>
    I don't miss no ex, I don't miss no text<br>
    I choose not to respond<br>
    I don't regret, just pretend shit never happened<br>
    Half of us layin' waste to our youth, is in the present<br>
    Half of us chasin' fountains of youth and it's in the present now<br>
    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind<br>
    You've been making me feel like I'm<br>
    Always in my mind, always in my mind, mind</p><br>

<p>When you do your best you ca-, I done told you<br>
    When you do your best, hell, that's all you can do<br>
   You, me and anybody else<br>
    So they always start talkin'<br>
    Ooh<br>
    Runnin' away from where I'm from<br>
    Never can stay with no one<br>
   Loving you almost feels like something<br>
    When no ones around me, you lost and found me<br>
    I was surrounded<br>
    With open, open, open, open arms (ooh)<br>
    Open arms, you keep me open<br>
    I'm so devoted<br>
    You keep me open, open arms<br>
    I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you<br>
   Spent your life bein' hopeless<br>
    Chokin' on insecurity<br>
    I know all this is bad<br>
    But, please, put a leash on me anyway<br>
    Who needs self-esteem anyway?<br>
    I hate myself to make you stay<br>
    Push me away, I'll be right here<br>
    With open, open, open, open arms (ooh)<br>
    Open arms, you keep me open<br>
    I'm so devoted<br>
    You keep me open, open arms<br>
    I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you<br>
   No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided (ayy)<br>
    I'm forever ridin' (whoa), you're forever guidin' (ayy)<br>
    Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (brr)<br>
    Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence (ooh)<br>
    You my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me<br>
    You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, "Where you takin' me?"<br>
    Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me<br>
    Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me<br>
    For you I try, face card valid, ID<br>
    C'est la vie, go to Paris, it ain't five-star, it ain't me<br>
    Over-solid, keep it concrete, I'ma bet it on your whole fee<br>
    Just don't switch sides, I could fire piece your wrist, AP<br>
    Through the ups and downs and all the heat<br>
    Take a turn and tell you what it be<br>
    Backshots make you feel relief, anything, just don't you ever leave<br>
    I guess I gotta go<br>
    I guess it's time to go<br>
    I gotta let you go<br>
    (I'm so devoted)<br>
    You keep me open<br>
    Gotta let you go, gotta let you go<br>
    I gotta let you go, I must<br>
    You're the only one that's holdin' me down<br>
    (You're the only one holdin' me down)<br>
    ('Cause I'm the only one that's holdin' me down)</p><br>
